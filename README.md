# Excel Word Count Functions (VBA)

This repository provides three easy-to-use VBA functions for Microsoft Excel that accurately count words in cells. These functions use basic string manipulation (specifically, space-based splitting) to estimate word counts in Excel cells. They do not currently use regular expressions.

## üìå Functions Included

### 1. `WordCount(cell As Range) ‚Üí Long`

**Description:**
Returns the number of words contained in a single Excel cell.

**Usage Example:**
```excel
=WordCount(A1)
```

---

### 2. `CountWordsOver(cutoff As Long, ParamArray cells() As Variant) ‚Üí Long`

**Description:**
Counts how many of the provided cells have word counts greater than the specified threshold.

**Usage Example:**
```excel
=CountWordsOver(50, A1, A2, A3)
```

---

### 3. `CountWordsOverVerbose(cutoff As Long, ParamArray cells() As Variant) ‚Üí String`

**Description:**
Returns both the number of cells exceeding the specified word count threshold and their respective word counts.

**Usage Example:**
```excel
=CountWordsOverVerbose(50, A1, A2, A3)
```

**Sample Output:**
```
Count: 2 ‚Äî Over 50: 54, 61
```

## üöÄ Quick Installation Guide

Follow these steps to use the functions in your Excel workbook:

1. Open your Excel workbook.
2. Press `Alt + F11` (Windows) or `Option + Fn + F11` (Mac) to launch the VBA editor.
3. Right-click within the Project window and select `Insert > Module`.
4. Copy and paste the VBA code from this repository into the new module.
5. Save your workbook as a macro-enabled workbook (`.xlsm`).

## ‚ú® Suggestions for Improvement:
To improve these functions to count words exactly as Microsoft Word does, consider modifying them to use regular expressions (e.g., via the VBScript RegExp object in VBA). This would better handle edge cases like multiple spaces, punctuation, and line breaks. üß†

## ‚öôÔ∏è Compatibility

- ‚úÖ Compatible with Microsoft Excel on both Windows and Mac.
- ‚úÖ Requires enabling macros in Excel.
- ‚ùå Does not use regular expressions. Word counts are estimated using space-based splitting and may differ slightly from Microsoft Word's counts in edge cases (e.g., multiple spaces or special characters).
